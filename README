1 Day Build

Rules:
1. ONE build a day.
  A. This is a game, it "should" be fun!
  B. A build is defined as:
    a. Everything that wasn't there before and now serves a "stand-alone" function.
    b. If the documentation is properly followed, the build can be replicated.
    c. Is open source and/or open hardware, if not, the service should be open to other
       people to use.
2. Build limited time: 2 hrs a day.
  A. Limited time includes writing code, physical building.
  B. Limited time does not include: research, material, testing and simple repairs.
3. Documentation.
  A. Documentation time: 30 minutes a day.
    a. This is loosely enforced because documentation usually is more inportant
       than the build itself.
    b. Twitter publications and YouTube publications DOES NOT COUNT as documentation.
       They only do when it is the only documentation piece of the project.
  B. Documentation has to be written in English, if it is documented on another language
     it may count as a complement of another document written in English.
4. Progressive Builds.
  A. One build can be one small part of a bigger build or the integration of such builds.
5. Open Source.
  B. All builds should be open sourced in the proper media. Code and some other scripts
     (like Eagle libraries) should be published in Github or Bitbucket and instructions
     in blog posts.
6. Joint builds
  A. Joint builds can be discussed, repaired, debugged or edited if the parties involved
     are available.
  B. If all the parties involved have exeeded the 2 hrs a day mark, then everyone shoud
     stop working until the next day. Note: 24 hrs accountability is not enforced.
